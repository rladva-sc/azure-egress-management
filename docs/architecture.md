# Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Azure Egress Management system.

## Overview

The system is designed with a modular architecture to monitor, analyze, and visualize Azure network egress patterns.

## Components

### Authentication Module

Handles secure authentication to Azure services using various authentication methods:
- Default Azure Credential
- Interactive Browser Authentication
- Service Principal Authentication

### Monitoring Module

Collects egress metrics from Azure resources:
- Virtual Machines
- App Services
- Virtual Networks
- Load Balancers
- Public IPs

### Analysis Module

Processes collected metrics to:
- Identify usage patterns
- Detect anomalies
- Calculate costs
- Generate optimization recommendations

### Dashboard Module

Provides visualization of:
- Current egress usage
- Historical patterns
- Cost analysis
- Optimization opportunities

## Data Flow

1. Authentication with Azure services
2. Resource discovery
3. Metrics collection
4. Data processing and storage
5. Analysis and reporting
6. Visualization and alerting

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Azure SDK for Python
- Dash/Plotly for visualization
- Pytest for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
